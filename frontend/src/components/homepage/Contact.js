            question: "What is STS?",
            answer:
                "Streets to Schools is a youth non-government organization that was founded in 2017 by Qjiel Mariano after attending the Young Bridging Leaders Program. Seeing the current condition of children and the struggles they face with their education and basic rights, what started as a passion project to serve the children evolved into a full-fledged organization with 17 chapters across the nation. STS is composed of young people aged 13 to 25 that aims to actively bridge children and youth in street situations, empowering them towards a brighter future.",
